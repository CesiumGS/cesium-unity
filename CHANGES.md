## v1.12.0 - 2024-09-02

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- Player builds for macOS now require macOS 10.15+. Previously, 10.13+ was supported.

##### Additions :tada:

- Editor builds for macOS now target macOS 10.15+. Previously, macOS 12.7+ was required.
- Added `originPlacement` property to `CesiumGeoreference` to toggle between "Cartographic Origin" and "True Origin" reference modes. Whereas "Cartographic Origin" is the default for georeferenced tilesets, "True Origin" may be used for non-georeferenced tilesets centered at the origin.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug that prevented using the Token panel with a new Cesium ion Server that had never had its token set before.
- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash in `CesiumIonSession` when the object was garbage collected or the AppDomain was unloaded while network requests were in progress.
- Fixed a bug that could cause `CesiumFlyToController` to unexpectedly interrupt a flight.
- glTF `doubleSided` materials are now supported. Previously, models using this property would appear inside-out.
- Fixed a bug that prevented clipping with CesiumCartographicPolygon from working with HDRP.

This release updates [cesium-native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native) from v0.38.0 to v0.39.0. See the [changelog](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for a complete list of changes in cesium-native.

  - The ellipsoid can be changed by specifying a `CesiumEllipsoid` asset in the new "Ellipsoid Override" property of a `CesiumGeoreference`.
  - New `CesiumEllipsoid` assets can be created using the menu option `Assets > Create > Cesium > Ellipsoid`.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Cesium for Unity now links statically against the MSVC runtime library on Windows, avoiding the need for an MSVC redistributable to be installed.
- Fixed a bug that caused Cesium ion tokens selected on the Tokens panel to fail to save.
- Fixed a bug that caused the "Select Cesium ion Token" panel to show the wrong state when the current token was not from the currently-signed-in Cesium ion account, but the signed-in account had a token named after the current Unity project.

This release updates [cesium-native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native) from v0.36.0 to v0.37.0. See the [changelog](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for a complete list of changes in cesium-native.

In addition to the above, this release updates [cesium-native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native) from v0.34.0 to v0.35.0. See the [changelog](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for a complete list of changes in cesium-native.

### v1.9.0 - 2024-04-01

##### Additions :tada:

- Added `CesiumWebMapTileServiceRasterOverlay`, which enables Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) imagery to be draped on a `Cesium3DTileset`.
- Added support for the `KHR_texture_transform` glTF extension - including rotation - for picking with `CesiumFeatureIdTexture`.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Normal, metallic-roughness, and occlusion textures from glTF models will now be correctly treated as linear rather than sRGB.
- Fixed a bug where UVs were not properly interpolated in `CesiumFeatureIdTexture.GetFeatureIdFromHit`, resulting in incorrect values.

In addition to the above, this release updates [cesium-native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native) from v0.33.0 to v0.34.0. See the [changelog](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for a complete list of changes in cesium-native.

### v1.8.0 - 2024-03-01

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- Feature IDs and metadata are now parsed through the `EXT_mesh_features` and `EXT_structural_metadata` extensions respectively. Models with `EXT_feature_metadata` will still be parsed, but their metadata will no longer be accessible.
- `CesiumDefaultTilesetMaterial` and `CesiumUnlitTilesetMaterial` have had their overlay-related parameters renamed. For instance, `_overlay0TextureCoordinateIndex` has now become `_overlayTextureCoordinateIndex_0`. Custom materials that relied on the previous naming scheme may break.

##### Additions :tada:

- Added `CesiumCartographicPolygon` and `CesiumPolygonRasterOverlay`, which together can be used to clip out polygonal areas of a `Cesium3DTileset`. These new classes are _only_ available in Unity 2022.2+ because they require Unity's Splines package.
- Added `CesiumFeatureIdSet`, which represents a feature ID set in `EXT_mesh_features`.
- Added `CesiumFeatureIdAttribute` and `CesiumFeatureIdTexture`, which derive from `CesiumFeatureIdSet` and respectively represent a feature ID attribute and feature ID texture in `EXT_mesh_features`.
- Added `CesiumPrimitiveFeatures`, a component that provides access to the `EXT_mesh_features` on a glTF primitive when it is loaded by `Cesium3DTileset`.
- Added `CesiumPropertyTableProperty`, which represents a property table property in `EXT_structural_metadata` and can be used to retrieve metadata.
- Added `CesiumPropertyTable`, which represents a property table in `EXT_structural_metadata`.
- Added `CesiumModelMetadata`, a component that provides access to the `EXT_structural_metadata` on a glTF model when it is loaded by `Cesium3DTileset`.
- Added `CesiumMetadataValue`, which can hold a metadata value from `EXT_structural_metadata` while abstracting away its type.
- Added a `distance` property to `CesiumOriginShift`, which specifies the maximum allowed distance from the current origin before it is shifted.
- Added support for the `KHR_texture_transform` glTF extension - including rotation - in `baseColorTexture`, `metallicRoughnessTexture`, `emissiveTexture`, `normalTexture`, and `occlusionTexture`. The transformation is now applied on the GPU via nodes in the Material, rather than on the CPU by directly modifying texture coordinates.
- Added `materialKey` to `CesiumRasterOverlay`, which matches the overlay to its corresponding parameters in the tileset's material. This allows for explicit ordering of raster overlays and overlay-specific effects.
- `CesiumCameraController` can now accept custom input actions that override the default inputs.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Removed the "Universal Additional Camera Data" script from DynamicCamera, as it shows up as a missing script in other render pipelines.
- Fixed a bug where adding a `CesiumSubScene` as the child of an existing `CesiumGeoreference` in editor would cause the parent `CesiumGeoreference` to have its coordinates reset to the default.
- Fixed the "DynamicCamera is not nested inside a game object with a CesiumGeoreference" warning when adding a new DynamicCamera in the editor.
- Fixed support for loading textures with less than four channels.
- Fixed "Destroying assets is not permitted to avoid data loss" error when using a custom opaque material with texture assets on a `Cesium3DTileset`.
- Fixed jump at the end of the flight path in `CesiumFlyToController`.

##### Deprecated :hourglass_flowing_sand:

- `CesiumMetadata` has been deprecated. Instead, retrieve the `CesiumModelMetadata` component attached to a tile game object in order to access its glTF metadata.
- `CesiumFeature` has been deprecated. Instead, retrieve feature IDs from the `CesiumPrimitiveFeatures` component attached to a primitive game object in order to access its glTF features. Feature IDs can be used to retrieve metadata from the `CesiumModelMetadata` attached to its parent.
- `flyToGranularityDegrees` in `CesiumFlyToController` has been deprecated. `CesiumFlyToController` no longer works using keypoints, so this value is unnecessary.

In addition to the above, this release updates [cesium-native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native) from v0.27.4 to v0.33.0. See the [changelog](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for a complete list of changes in cesium-native.

- Fixed a bug that could cause missing textures when using two raster overlays with the same projection on a single tileset.
- Fixed a bug where changing the origin on a `CesiumGeoreference` would not propogate these changes to the active `CesiumSubScene`, if one exists.
- Reduced the amount of extraneous camera rotation in the `CesiumCameraController` after a frame hitch by using `Time.smoothDeltaTime`.
- Fixed a bug that caused mipmaps to be generated for textures that shouldn't be mipmapped, sometimes leading to cracks between tiles and other problems.

In addition to the above, this release updates [cesium-native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native) from v0.24.0 to v0.25.0. See the [changelog](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for a complete list of changes in cesium-native.

### v1.2.0 - 2023-05-09

##### Additions :tada:

- Added a `scale` property to `CesiumGeoreference`. This allows the entire globe to be scaled up or down with better precision than the scale property on the georeference's `Transform`.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug that caused tiles to be displaced when changing the transform of a `CesiumGeoreference` at runtime.
- Fixed a bug that caused primitive numbers to be negative in the names of tile game objects when the tile mesh had multiple primitives.

### v1.1.0 - 2023-05-01

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- `CesiumObjectPool` is no longer accessible from outside the CesiumRuntime assembly.

##### Additions :tada:

- Added support for primitives with the `TRIANGLE_STRIP` and `TRIANGLE_FAN` topology types.
- Missing normals are now generated as "flat" normals by default, as required by the glTF specification. An option on `Cesium3DTileset` allows the user to request smooth normals instead, which will improve performance for most meshes by reducing geometry duplication.
- Moved mipmap generation from the main thread to a worker thread.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Added dependencies on the ShaderGraph and InputSystem packages to resolve material / script compilation errors.
- Fixed another bug where `CesiumCameraController` tried to access a non-existent input in the legacy input system.
- Removed an extra "delimiter" added to the end of on-screen credits in some cases.
- Fixed a memory leak of `Mesh` objects when entering and exiting Play mode in the Unity Editor.
- Fixed a crash that happened when attempting to create physics meshes for degenerate triangle meshes.

In addition to the above, this release updates [cesium-native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native) from v0.23.0 to v0.24.0. See the [changelog](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for a complete list of changes in cesium-native.

### v1.0.0 - 2023-04-03

##### Additions :tada:

- Added `CesiumPointCloudShading`, which allows point cloud tilesets to be rendered with attenuation based on geometric error. Attenuation is currently only supported in the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).
- `GameObject` instances created for the tiles in a `Cesium3DTileset` now inherit the `layer` of the parent tileset.
- Added the `CesiumTileExcluder` abstract class. By creating a class derived from `CesiumTileExcluder`, then adding it to a `Cesium3DTileset`'s game object, you can implement custom rules for excluding tiles in the `Cesium3DTileset` from loading and rendering.
- Added setting in `CesiumRuntimeSettings` to configure the maximum number of responses to keep in the request cache.
- Added setting in `CesiumRuntimeSettings` to configure the number of reads from the cache database before each prune.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug that prevented the use of pre-existing mipmaps, such as those loaded from KTX2.
- Fixed a bug where `CesiumCameraController` tried to access non-existent inputs in the legacy input system.
- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when using the search box with a dataset already selected in the Cesium ion Assets window.
- Fixed a bug that prevented sorting the contents of the Cesium ion Assets window in descending order.

### v0.3.0

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- Removed the `positionAuthority`, `unityX`, `unityY`, and `unityZ` properties from `CesiumGlobeAnchor`. Also removed the `SetPositionUnity` method.
- Removed the `CesiumGlobeAnchorPositionAuthority` enum. The authoritative position is now always found in the `positionGlobeFixed` property. The object's Unity world position can be obtained from its `Transform`.
- Marked the `longitude`, `latitude`, and `height` properties on `CesiumGlobeAnchor` as obsolete. Use the `longitudeLatitudeHeight` property instead.
- Marked the `ecefX`, `ecefY`, and `ecefZ` properties on `CesiumGlobeAnchor` as obsolete. Use the `positionGlobeFixed` property instead.
- Marked `SetPositionLongitudeLatitudeHeight` and `SetPositionEarthCenteredEarthFixed` methods on `CesiumGlobeAnchor` as obsolete. Set the `longitudeLatitudeHeight` or `positionGlobeFixed` property instead.
- Replaced `MetadataProperty` with `CesiumFeature`. Metadata features are now separated based on feature tables where properties are accessed by name.
- Replaced `CesiumMetadata.GetProperties` with `CesiumMetadata.GetFeatures`, which returns an array of `CesiumFeature`s.

##### Additions :tada:

- Added support for rendering point clouds (`pnts`).
- `CesiumGlobeAnchor` now stores a precise, globe-relative orientation and scale in addition to position.
- Added `localToGlobeFixedMatrix`, `longitudeLatitudeHeight`, `positionGlobeFixed`, `rotationGlobeFixed`, `rotationEastUpNorth`, `scaleGlobeFixed`, and `scaleEastUpNorth` properties to `CesiumGlobeAnchor`.
- Added the `Restart` method to `CesiumGlobeAnchor`, which can be use to reinitialize the component from its serialized values.
- Moved the Cesium tileset shaders from the `Shader Graphs` shader category to the new `Cesium` shader category.
- Added `CesiumDebugColorizeTilesRasterOverlay` to visualize how a tileset is divided into tiles.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug that prevented caching of 3D Tiles and overlay requests.
- Fixed a bug that could cause the Cesium ion Token Troubleshooting panel to crash the Unity Editor.
- Added a workaround for a crash in the Burst Compiler (bcl.exe) in Unity 2022.2 when using il2cpp.
- Fixed a bug that could cause incorrect metadata to be associated with a feature, especially in Draco-encoded tiles.

In addition to the above, this release updates [cesium-native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native) from v0.21.3 to v0.22.0. See the [changelog](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for a complete list of changes in cesium-native.

- Added `CesiumFlyToController`, a controller that can smoothly fly to locations across the globe.
- Added an option to add a `DynamicCamera` from the Cesium panel to the scene. The `DynamicCamera` contains `CesiumCameraController` and `CesiumFlyToController` components and offers easy navigation of the globe.
- Added support for building to iOS.
- Added support for building to Android x86-64 devices like the Magic Leap 2.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug where `CesiumGeoreference`, `CesiumGlobeAnchor`, and `CesiumSubScene` would not properly update when their values were changed by undos or pasted values.
- `CesiumRuntimeSettings` is now stored in `Assets/CesiumSettings/Resources` instead of `Assets/Settings/Resources`.
- Added an explicit `Physics.SyncTransforms` when `CesiumOriginShift` activates or deactivates sub-scenes, avoiding a brief period of potentially very incorrect collisions.

In addition to the above, this release updates [cesium-native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native) from v0.21.1 to v0.21.3. See the [changelog](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for a complete list of changes in cesium-native.
